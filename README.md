# IDEAlign
**IDEAlign** is a benchmarking paradigm for eliciting expert similarity judgments via an intuitive *pick-the-odd-one-out* task. Experts are presented with three annotations and asked to select the most dissimilar one according to a specified, domain-relevant criterion. Many such triplet decisions are aggregated to generate pairwise similarity scores for every annotation pair, which can then be compared with automated measures of similarity. The alignment of automated measures with expert judgments is evaluated using Spearman rank correlation coefficients between the similarity ranked pairs by experts and the pairs ranked by the model.
